# FinClip ChatKit

> **Stop building chat UIs from scratch.**
> The complete toolkit for building native AI-powered chat applications on mobile apps.

[简体中文](README.zh.md) | [English](README.md)

Building the intelligence for your AI agent is hard enough. Don't waste weeks fighting with list views, keyboard handling, and message bubbles. ChatKit gives you a **production-ready chat interface** that feels 100% native, right out of the box.

## 🚀 Get Started in 5 Minutes

We know you want to see code running. Choose your path:

### 🍎 For iOS Developers
* **Swift?** → [**Jump to Swift Quick Start**](docs/getting-started.md#swift-quick-start) (The modern way)
* **Objective-C?** → [**Jump to Obj-C Quick Start**](docs/getting-started.md#objective-c-quick-start) (Legacy codebase? We got you.)

### 🤖 For Android Developers

## 🏗 What Can You Build?

ChatKit is designed to scale from simple embedded widgets to full-blown AI assistants.

  <img src="docs/assets/from-components-to-solutions.jpg" width="100%">
</div>

### 1. Embedded Context-Aware Copilots
Don't force users to leave their current task to get help. Embed ChatKit as a **mini-program overlay** or a **floating entry** directly within your existing workflows (e.g., stock charts, dashboards).
* **Context Injection**: Automatically pass the current screen's data to the LLM. The agent "sees" what the user sees.
* **Non-intrusive**: Users summon the agent for specific tasks and dismiss it immediately.

### 2. Vertical Expert Agents
Build independent, professional-grade AI assistants (like *Project Samantha*) capable of handling complex domain logic.
* **Generative UI**: Render complex financial tables, forms, or interactive charts dynamically using **MCP-UI** or **AG-UI** protocols.
* **One-Shot Execution**: Turn natural language (e.g., "Buy 100 shares of AAPL") into secure, sandboxed actions immediately—bypassing deep menus.

### 3. Hybrid Human-AI Workflows
Don't leave users stranded when the AI hits a limit.
* **Seamless Handoff**: Automatically route high-stakes or complex intent to human agents without losing conversation context.
* **Huddle Mode**: Enable a unique **three-way collaboration** (User + AI + Human) where the AI acts as a copilot for the human advisor.

## 💡 Why ChatKit?

**Context is King.** Generic chatbots fail because they don't know who the user is. ChatKit connects the dots.

</div>

* **Frictionless**: No need to ask "Where are you?". The SDK already knows.
* **Proactive**: Trigger actions based on location, time, or battery status.

## 💡 Why Developers Love ChatKit

We fit your workflow, whether you need speed or control.

🏎️ **Ship Fast (High-Level APIs)**: Need a chat screen now? Components like `ChatKitConversationViewController` handle lifecycle and UI rendering for you. [Read Guide](docs/api-levels.md#high-level-apis-recommended)

🛠️ **Full Control (Low-Level APIs)**: Need custom layouts? Drop down to direct runtime access and manual UI binding. [Read Guide](docs/api-levels.md#low-level-apis-advanced)

🧩 **Make It Yours (Providers)**: Inject Location, Calendar events, or custom data directly into the LLM context. [Context Providers Guide](docs/guides/context-providers.md)
